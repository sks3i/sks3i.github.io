For the initial experimentation, I'll be running HA OS on my Windows 10 laptop and dashboard on my iPad. This is just following the instructions in Home Assistant site, so feel free to skip this and refer to OG site.

I used VirtualBox to run HAOS on Windows 10. It is pretty straightforward. And for iOS install Home Assistant app from the App Store.
